In today's world, data analysis plays a crucial role in various fields like business, research, and weather forecasting. This project focuses on extracting insights from music-related data using Python, with Spotify as the central platform. By analyzing its data, we can understand trends, user preferences, and the impact of different features like song sharing and synchronized lyrics.
Throughout this project, I used Python libraries to process, analyze, and visualize data. Working in Jupyter Notebook made it easier to explore patterns and gain valuable insights. This experience not only sharpened my data analysis skills but also deepened my understanding of how data connects with the music industry. I now feel more confident in taking on similar projects in the future. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out—I’d love to discuss and help!
